**License Information**

The :ref:`modified Artistic License <MODIFIEDARTISTICLICENSE>`
is based on the ArtisticLicense2.0, but
adds the amendmend of "Forced-Fairplay-Constraints" for peer-to-peer fairplay
rules.
The modification restricts, and even revokes the permission including the open source attribution
in case of breaches, including the past.
   
   .. parsed-literal::
   
      License:ModifiedArtisticLicense2.0 = ArtisticLicense2.0 + Forced-Fairplay-Constraints 
      From Ingenieurbuero Arno-Can Uestuensoez
      Name  ModifiedArtisticLicense2.0

This is perfectly allright, as you may refer to cases like the faith of Andreas Pavel [AndreasPavel]_,
or even my own - UnifiedSessionsManager (C) 2008 Arno-Can Uestuensoez [UnifiedSessionsManager]_ - the
first multivendor cloud management system, capable of distributed hybrid clouds including virtual desktops.
The *UnifiedSessionsManager* was originally licensed as *GPL3*. 

So the software is OpenSource as long as you comply to basic rules - else not.
