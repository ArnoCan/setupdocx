Why use multiple document configurations?
-----------------------------------------
Because:

#. Multiple document types have to be created.
#. Multiple themes have to be used.
#. You may not want to publish the complete set of your documentation.
#. You may not want to publish patched third-party projects with a different license, and 
   a different document theme.
