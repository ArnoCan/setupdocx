Abstract
********

This package serves as a pre-release placeholder for the package *setupdocx* under development.
The main intention is to reserve the package name in order to assure the
availability of currently introduced software labels and documentation references.
The second target is to provide a template for the initial configuration of the various 
webresources and automation scripts.

The completed package is going to be released soon.
