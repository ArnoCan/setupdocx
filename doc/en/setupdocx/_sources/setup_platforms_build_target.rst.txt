Build and Target Platforms
==========================

The supported platforms for the document creaion and the target of the documentation
do not need to be the same.
This is in particular not required for target systems with limited runtime resources. 

Build Platforms
---------------
The supported build platforms are all major OS - BSD, Linux, MacOS/OS-X, Unix, and
Windows - with the Python implementations CPython, IPython, IronPython, Jython,
and PyPy.
This includes ARM based platforms such as Raspberry-PI,
see :ref:`INSTALL_PREREQUISITES`. 

Target Platforms
----------------
The target platforms comprise any platform with a supported reader for the created document format.
This is eventually limited for some formats such as HTML, when the theme requires JavaScript for
embedded devices with lack of support.
